## git basics 

Note:
Explain with Abstract

+++

- Version control |
- git ≠ github |
- commit = save snapshot of current status |
- remote vs local |

---

## branch & merge
![](http://palo-it.com/wp-content/uploads/Feature-Branch.png)

+++

- one master |
- plus eg: development branch |
- plus every step in working |
- branches are still there after merging |

---

## How does it help?

+++

- ~~MyApp_redesign_V3_new_final_updated2_final_new.sketch~~ 
- collaboration |
- know what's the most recent version |
- revert, review, history |
- communicate changes to team |
- scalability |

### :/ the bad
- you should know basics of git |
- diff view is weird |
- slow with complex files |
- no comments/viewers/etc like Abstract |
- UI far from perfect |

+++


## :) the good
- works with git under the hood |
- splits .sketch file and saves it as text -->layer-based |
- open system, can alyways generate sketch file  |
- auto updates open sketch file (sometimes) |
- active development |
- open source(?) |

### (≧◡≦) the shiny
