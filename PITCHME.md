# Git for Designers

## git basics 

Note:
Explain with Abstract

+++

- Version control |
- git vs github |
- commit = save snapshot of current status |
- remote vs local |

---

## git = version control plus + "branch" & "merge"

+++

- one master |
- plus eg: development branch |
- plus every step in working |

branches are still there after merging, so maybe name them with date to keep overview |

---

## Why this is a good idea?

+++

- collaboration |
- know what's the most recent version |
- revert, review, history |
- communicate changes to team |
- scalability |
- no `MyApp-redesign-V3-new_final_updated2-final-new.sketch` |

### (+) the good

+++

###(-) the bad
- UI far from perfect |
- you should know basics of git |
- diff not perfect |
- slow with complex files |
- no comments/viewers/etc like Abstract |
- not stable yet v0.2.5 |

+++

###(+) the good
- works with git under the hood |
- splits .sketch file and saves it as text -->layer-based |
- open system, can alyways export(generate) sketch file  |
- auto updates open sketch file (sometimes) |
- active development |
- open source(?) |
- self hosted mit github enterprise |

help out and improve it! (bug reports, etc): https://github.com/kactus-io |

---

## git best practices 
- don't work on the same branch |
- commit early and often |
- commit messages start with verb |
- meaningful descriptions |

thanks!
