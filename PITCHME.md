# Git for Designers

## git basics 

Note:
Explain with Abstract

+++

- Version control
- git vs github
- commit = save snapshot of current status
- remote vs local

---

## git = version control plus + "branch" & "merge"

+++

- one master
- plus eg: development branch
- plus every step in working

branches are still there after merging, so maybe name them with date to keep overview

---

## Why this is a good idea?

+++

- collaboration
- know what's the most recent version
- revert, review, history
- communicate changes to team
- scalability
- no MyApp-redesign-V3-new_final_updated2.sketch

---

## best practices
- don't work on the same branch
- commit early and often
- meaningful descriptions
- commit messages start with verb
