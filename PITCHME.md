## git basics 

Note:
Explain with Abstract

+++

- Version control |
- git ≠ github |
- commit = save snapshot of current status |
- remote vs local |

---

## branch & merge
![](http://palo-it.com/wp-content/uploads/Feature-Branch.png)

+++

- one master |
- plus eg: development branch |
- plus every step in working |
- branches are still there after merging |

---

## How does it help?

+++

- ~~MyApp_redesign_V3_new_final_updated2_final_new.sketch~~ 
- collaboration |
- know what's the most recent version |
- revert, review, history |
- communicate changes to team |
- scalability |

## But how!?

# Abstract

### :) the good
- thought-through, polished 
- easy to get going
- no need to understand git
- comments
- collections
- viewers are free

+++

###  :/ the bad
- closed system
- Artboard-based

+++

### (⊙_◎) the ugly
- it's all in the cloud 

---

## other Apps:
Folio  
PlantApp  
Layervault  
Pixelapse  
git sketch plugin |

---

# Kactus
kactus.io

0/5/12 $/month

+++

### :/ the bad
- you should know basics of git |
- diff view is weird |
- slow with complex files |
- no comments/viewers/etc like Abstract |
- UI far from perfect |

+++


## :) the good
- works with git under the hood |
- splits .sketch file and saves it as text -->layer-based |
- open system, can alyways generate sketch file  |
- auto updates open sketch file (sometimes) |
- active development |
- open source(?) |

+++

### (≧◡≦) the shiny
- self hosting possible with github enterprise |

+++

### (⊙_◎) the ugly
- not stable yet v0.2.5 


help out and improve it! (bug reports, etc): https://github.com/kactus-io

---

## git best practices 
- don't work on the same branch |
- commit early and often |
- commit messages start with verb |
- meaningful descriptions |
